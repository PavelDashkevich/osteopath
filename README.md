## Osteopath app

### Apps purpose

The purpose of the app is to help osteopath to schedule sessions and to manage resolving disfunctions of its customers.

### Description

Disfunction is abnormal functioning of any part of human body.
Osteopath is a specialist who “fixes” disfunctions, brings the body in normal functioning state.
To manage disfunctions osteopath can describe them, set proper category, pick them in session and add working plan.
Available functions to manage customers: categorizing based on categories of disfunctions and general plan of work.
Scheduling of sessions includes settings of working days, possibilities to plan session or non-session time blocks (when the osteopath needs time to do some personal things, f. e. take its own child to the dentist).
